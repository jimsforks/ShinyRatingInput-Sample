This example Shiny app shows how to use the [ShinyRatingInput package]("https://github.com/stefanwilhelm/ShinyRatingInput") to build rating input controls in Shiny apps. Rating inputs can be created as static UI or using renderUI().

ShinyRatingInput uses the [https://github.com/dreyescat/bootstrap-rating](href="https://github.com/dreyescat/bootstrap-rating") JavaScript library, so the credits should go there. 

Thanks to the [shinythemes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinythemes) package 
for providing the Bootstrap theme selector.
